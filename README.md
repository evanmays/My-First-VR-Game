# My-First-VR-Game

I'm making a VR game in 21 days. Keep up with development progress on my blog. https://evanmays.com/blog/

## How to play the game
You'll need Node.JS/npm on your computer. Along with Python3 and the http package.
In terminal, run "node server.js"
In terminal, run "python -m http.server"

In game.js, put your IP address in on the line starting with "var socket"
This should be a local IP so your phone can load the game from the computer server.

Make sure the port for the socket var matches the port of your node server.

Now load the site on your computer and phone and follow instructions on the website.
